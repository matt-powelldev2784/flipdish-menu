# Flipdish Menu Task

## To get started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm run dev
4. Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser

## My approach
Build app with Vite, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS using template form Vite Community.
Implement unit testing with Vitest and React Testing Library.

* Define TypeScript types for the data structure
* The main structure is MenuSections, MenuItems, MenuItemsOptionSets, and MenuItemOptionSetItems
* Create a Menu component that will render the menu by passing each sub section as props
* Handle null or missing values in the data
* Handle IsMasterOptionSet flag to calculate the price
* Add tests to ensure the data is rendered correctly
